# Bachelor Thesis - Usability testing of proximity detection
*Conception, implementation and evaluation of a touchinteraction-support through proximity recognition on smartphones.*

## Abstract 
A study with 18 test persons was done to get a better understanding of the usability of proximity detection and the evaluation of the minimum size of control elements. The test persons did two different tests on a smartphone with integrated proximity detection and the associated test application. Several tasks with changing states of the proximity detection were made. Differences of several parameters were determined on the basis of the collected data. It could be shown that the task completion had been simplified.
